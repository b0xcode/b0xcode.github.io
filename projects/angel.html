    <h2>"Biblically Accurate" Angels: What are they, really?</h2>
    <br><p>*insert relevant intro here*</p>
    <br><p><h3>So what is "biblically accurate"?</h3></p>

    <p><br>Let's start with angels in scripture. 
        In the vast majority of mentions of angels in the Bible, we get very little in way of actual physical description. Here's a typical depiction of an angel, from Mathew 28:2, when Mary Magdalene and Mary, mother of Christ are at Jesus' tomb:
    </p>
<p><br>
"There was a violent earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and, going to the tomb, rolled back the stone and sat on it. 3 His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow."
</p>
<p><br>
This angel has an appearance like lightning, but is clothed and can be seen to "sit" on the stone, after rolling it back. In Daniel 9:20, Gabriel the messanger angel is referred to as a "man". These writings seem to be entirely consistent with the humanoid depictions of angels that are so common throughout art and culture. The "appearance like lightning" that Matthew was talking about is probably a way of describing a kind of heavenly light or "radiance" that angels seem to have, as spiritual servants of God.
</p>
<p><br>
There's one thing conspicuously missing from these descriptions, however. Do angels have wings?
</p>
<p><br>
Well, strictly speaking, not really. There's no actual biblical mention of angels appearing to have "wings" (except in the Book of Ezekiel and the Book of Revelations, but we'll get to that). Angels are definitely referred to as "flying" though, and as such have been depicted for centuries as having wings in art and culture.
</p>
<p><br>
As for ranks, hierarchies, or any further details about how God's primary servants organise themselves, we have only two uses of the word "archangel" in the Bible to work off of, with the word "archangel" meaning a kind of higher ranking angel or authority among angels. One of these biblical references is to an angel named Michael (Jude 1:9), the other one is a nonspecific reference to "the archangel" (Thessalonians 4:16). Gabriel is traditionally thought of as an archangel too, but there is nothing in the Bible to confirm that theory. There are two denominational texts that name more archangels: the archangel Raphael in the Book of Tobias and an archangel Uriel in the Second Book of Esdras. These texts aren't universal, however.
</p>
<p><br>
When I examine the biblical evidence, I can only conclude that most angels seem to just look like shiny humans and have no specific organisation other than some archangels who have some authority or greater power. Also they can fly, but wings are a stylistic choice.
</p>
<p><br>
"But wait!" you say, "Is that it? What about all the depictions where angels have many eyes and many wings? What about the glowing golden rings with eyes on them?"
<br>I hear you! Let's talk about that.
</p>

<p><br>
Firstly, the seraphim. A seraph is a kind of angel seen by the prophet Isaiah in a vision of God. From Isaiah 6:1-2:
</p>
<p><br>
"In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord, high and exalted, seated on a throne; and the train of his robe filled the temple. Above Him were seraphim, each with six wings: With two wings they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they were flying."
</p>
<p><br>
Isaiah 6:6 observes the seraphim as having hands too. So as far as we can tell, seraphim have humanoid forms with the exception of their wings that they use to fly and cover themselves, and they exist beside God as a sort of personal worship choir. Very cool.
</p>
<P><br> <i>that is all I have so far, but here's what I still have to cover:</P>
    <p><br>
        **now talk about the descriptions of cherubim and "whirling wheels" in Ezekiel 
        <br> **Are thrones angels?
        <br> **What the fuck is going on in The Book of Revelation? Damn
        <br> ** Beyond "biblical accuracy": the 9 denominations of angels
        <br> **In conclusion, don't believe everything you see on the internet, son.
