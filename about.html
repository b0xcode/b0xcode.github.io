        <h4>who are you?</h4>
        <p>My name is <span class="flavour">Marlon</span>, I'm 22 years old and an undergraduate at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia. Currently spending most of my time studying ancient tomes and hiking out of the Dunning-Kruger valley of computer knowledge.</p>
        <h4>what is this site?</h4>
        <p>My personal corner of the internet where I document my projects and activities, intended to act as a portfolio as well as an educational resource.</p>
        <p><span class="flavour">marlons.garden</span> is built using Jekyll and freely hosted on Github Pages. Best viewed on a desktop device.</p>
